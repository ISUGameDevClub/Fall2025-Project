//TO TEST THE VICTORY SCREEN, YOU MUST HAVE TWO PLAYER INPUTS
//1) Begin play mode
//2) Connect both players (both players should be visible on screen)
//3) Navigate to ONE of the player objects in the heirarchy
//4) Find the PlayerHealth script and its serialized fields
//5) Set totalStocks to 0
//6) Victory animation(s) will play
//NOTE: Most code is found in GameSequenceManager.cs
//There is functionality for a camera zoom idea, but it is currently commented out
//Will look more into it when we finish character select functionality and iron out gamemodes (1v1,2v2,etc..)
